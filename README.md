# Viking Hacks HackPacks

HackPacks are open source resources built by developers and contributors to help hackers build great projects at our hackathon that happens every April 28–29 at Diablo Valley College. The Viking Hacks Team has compiled a list of available hack packs for hackers to use. Feel free to use these at your own hackathons, workshops, and anything else that promotes building

Head to the Viking Hacks [website](https://dvcdevelopers.com/) to keep up to date.
