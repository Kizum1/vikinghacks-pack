# About Hack Packs

HackPacks are open source resources built by developers and contributors to help hackers build great projects at our hackathon that happens every April 28â€“29 at Diablo Valley College. The Viking Hacks Team has compiled a list of available hack packs for hackers to use. Feel free to use these at your own hackathons, workshops, and anything else that promotes building

Head to the Viking Hacks [website](https://dvcdevelopers.com/) to keep up to date.

Good luck hackers!
