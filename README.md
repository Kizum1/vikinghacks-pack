# About Hack Packs

HackPacks are open source resources built by developers and contributors to help hackers build great projects at our hackathon that happens every April 28/29th at Diablo Valley College. We believe that everyone of every skill level can learn to make awesome things, and this is one way we help facilitate hacker culture. The Viking Hacks Team has aggegrated a list of availiblle hackpacks for hackers to use. Feel free to use these at your own hackathons, workshops, and anything else that promotes building

Head to the viking hacks [website](dvcdevelopers.com) to keep up to date.

Good Luck Hackers
